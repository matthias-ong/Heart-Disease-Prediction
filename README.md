# Heart-Disease-Prediction
COMP90049 Final Project - Final Grade: 27/30

## Instructions:
- Run locally Jupyter Notebook or upload it to Google Colab. Tested on both.
- Download dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease?select=2022, make sure to select 'heart_2022_no_nans.csv' and place it in the same location as the Jupyter Notebook.
- Make sure all relevant libraries are installed if running locally. Requires pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imblearn, seaborn, matplotlib, etc.
- Then execute it. The last cell with Recursive Feature Elimination was excluded in my executions as it took a long time so you may choose to do so.
